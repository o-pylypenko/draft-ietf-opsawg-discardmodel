# Introduction        {#introduction}

The primary function of a network is to transport and deliver packets according to service level objectives. For network operators, understanding both where and why packet loss occurs within a network is essential for effective operation. Device-reported packet loss provides the most direct signal for identifying service impact. While certain types of packet loss, such as policy-based discards, are intentional and part of normal network operation, unintended packet loss can impact customer services.  To automate network operations, operators must be able to detect customer-impacting packet loss, determine its root cause, and apply appropriate mitigation actions. Precise classification of packet loss is crucial to ensure that anomalous packet loss is easily detected and that the right action is taken to mitigate the impact. Taking the wrong action can make problems worse; for example, removing a congested device from service can exacerbate congestion by redirecting traffic to other already congested links or devices.

Existing metrics for reporting packet loss, such as ifInDiscards, ifOutDiscards, ifInErrors, and ifOutErrors defined in MIB-II {{?RFC1213}} and the YANG Data Model for Interface Management {{?RFC8343}}, are insufficient for automating network operations.  First, they lack precision; for instance, ifInDiscards aggregates all discarded inbound packets without specifying the cause, making it challenging to distinguish between intended and unintended discards. Second, these definitions are ambiguous, leading to inconsistent vendor implementations. For example, in some implementations ifInErrors accounts only for errored packets that are dropped, while in others, it includes all errored packets, whether they are dropped or not. Many implementations support more discard metrics than these, however, they have been inconsistently implemented due to the lack of a standardised classification scheme and clear semantics for packet loss reporting. For example, {{?RFC7270}} provides support for reporting discards per flow in IPFIX using forwardingStatus, however, the defined drop reason codes also lack sufficient clarity to facilitate automated root cause analysis and impact mitigation, e.g., the "For us" reason code.

This document defines an information model and corresponding data model for packet loss reporting which address these issues.  The information model provides precise classification of packet loss to enable accurate automated mitigation.  The data model specifies a YANG implementation of this framework for network elements, while maintaining consistency through clear semantics.

The scope of this document is limited to reporting packet loss at Layer 3 and frames discarded at Layer 2. This document considers only the signals that may trigger automated mitigation actions and not how the actions are defined or executed.

{{problem}} describes the problem space and requirements. {{infomodel}} defines the information model and classification scheme. {{datamodel}} specifies the corresponding data model and implementation requirements together with a set of usage examples. {{datamodel-module}} provides the complete YANG module definition for the data model. The appendices provide the  YANG module definition for the information model, together with additional context and implementation guidance.

# Terminology {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

A packet discard accounts for any instance where a packet is dropped by a device, regardless of whether the discard was intentional or unintentional.

Intended discards are packets dropped due to deliberate network policies or configurations designed to enforce security or quality of service. For example, packets dropped because they match an Access Control List (ACL) denying certain traffic types.

Unintended discards are packets that were dropped, which the network operator otherwise intended to deliver, i.e. which indicates an error state.  There are many possible reasons for unintended packet loss, including: erroring links may corrupt packets in transit; incorrect routing tables may result in packets being dropped because they do not match a valid route; configuration errors may result in a valid packet incorrectly matching an ACL and being dropped.

Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in {{?RFC8340}}.

# Problem Statement   {#problem}

The fundamental problem for network operators is how to automatically detect when unintended packet loss is occurring and determine the appropriate action to mitigate it. For any network there are a small set of potential actions that can be taken to mitigate customer impact when unintended packet loss is detected:

1. Take a problematic device, link, or set of devices and/or links out of service.
2. Return a device, link, or set of devices and/or links back into service.
3. Move traffic to other links or devices to alleviate congestion or avoid problematic paths.
4. Roll back a recent change to a device that might have caused the problem.
5. Escalate to a network operator as a last resort when automated mitigation is not possible.

The ability to select the appropriate mitigation action depends on four key features of packet loss:

FEATURE-DISCARD-LOCATION:
: Determines which devices, interfaces and/or flows are impacted.

FEATURE-DISCARD-RATE:
: The rate and/or magnitude of the discards, indicating the severity and urgency of the problem.

FEATURE-DISCARD-DURATION:
: The duration of the discards which helps to distinguish transient from persistent issues.

FEATURE-DISCARD-CLASS:
: The type or class of discards, which is crucial for selecting the appropriate of mitigation - for example: error discards may require taking faulty components out of service; no-buffer discards may require traffic redistribution; policy discards typically require no automated action

While FEATURE-DISCARD-LOCATION, FEATURE-DISCARD-RATE, and FEATURE-DISCARD-DURATION are implicitly supported by MIB-II {{?RFC1213}} and the YANG Data Model for Interface Management {{?RFC8343}}, FEATURE-DISCARD-CLASS requires a more detailed classification scheme than they define. The following information model defines such a classification scheme to enable automated mapping from loss signals to appropriate mitigation actions.

# Information Model   {#infomodel}

The information model is defined using YANG {{?RFC6020}} with Data Structure Extensions {{!RFC8791}}, allowing the model to remain abstract and decoupled from specific implementations in accordance with {{?RFC3444}}. This abstraction supports different data model implementations - for example, in YANG, IPFIX {{?RFC7011}}, gMNI {{gMNI}} or SNMP {{?RFC1157}} - while ensuring consistency across implementations. Using YANG for the information model enables this abstraction, leverages the community's familiarity with its syntax, and ensures lossless translation to the corresponding YANG data model, which is defined in {{datamodel}}.

## Structure {#infomodel-structure}

The information model defines a hierarchical classification scheme for packet discards, which captures where in a device the discards are accounted (component), in which direction they were flowing (direction), whether they were successfully processed or discarded (type), what protocol layer they belong to (layer), and the specific reason for any discards (sub-types). This organisation enables both high-level monitoring of total discards and more detailed triage to map to mitigation actions.

A complete classification path follows the pattern: component/direction/type/layer/sub-type/sub-sub-type/.../metric. Appendix B illustrates where these discards typically occur in a network device.  The elements of the tree are defined as follows:

- Component:
  - interface: discards of traffic to or from a specific network interface.
  - device: discards of traffic transiting the device.
  - control-plane: discards of traffic to or from the device's control plane.
  - flow: discards of traffic associated with a specific traffic flow.

- Direction:
  - ingress: counters for incoming packets or frames.
  - egress: counters for outgoing packets or frames.

- Type:
  - traffic: counters for successfully received or transmitted packets or frames.
  - discards: counters for packets or frames that were dropped.

- Layer:
  - l2: Layer 2 traffic and discards, i.e. frame and byte counts.
  - l3: Layer 3 traffic and discards, i.e. packet and byte counts.

The hierarchical structure allows for future extension while maintaining backward compatibility. New discard types can be added as new branches without affecting existing implementations.

The following YANG tree diagram shows the complete structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./yang/draft-ietf-opsawg-discardmodel-tree.txt}
~~~~~~~~~~

The corresponding YANG module is defined in {{infomodel-module}}.

For additional context, {{wheredropped}} provides an example of where packets may be discarded in a device.

## Sub-type Definitions

discards/policy/:
: These are intended discards, meaning packets dropped by a device due to a configured policy, including: ACLs, traffic policers, Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) checks, DDoS protection rules and explicit null routes

discards/error/:
: These are unintended discards due to errors in processing packets or frames.  There are multiple sub-classes.

discards/error/l2/rx/:
: These are frames discarded due to errors in the received Layer 2 frame, including: CRC errors, invalid MAC addresses, invalid VLAN tags, frame size violations and other malformed frame conditions

discards/error/l3/rx/:
: These are discards which occur due to errors in the received packet, indicating an upstream problem rather than an issue with the device dropping the errored packets, including: header checksum errors,  MTU exceeded, invalid packet errors, i.e. incorrect version, incorrect header length, invalid options and other malformed packet conditions

discards/error/l3/rx/ttl-expired:
: These are discards due to TTL (or Hop limit) expiry, which can occur for the following reasons: normal trace-route operations, end-system TTL/Hop limit set too low, routing loops in the network.

discards/error/l3/no-route/:
: These are discards which occur due to a packet not matching any route in the routing table, e.g. which may be due to routing configuration errors or may be transient discards during convergence.

discards/error/local/:
: These are discards due to internal device issues, including: parity errors in device memory or other internal hardware errors.  Any errored discards not explicitly assigned to other classes are also accounted for here.

discards/no-buffer/:
:  These are discards due to buffer exhaustion, i.e. congestion related discards. These can be tail-drop discards or due to an active queue management algorithm, such as RED {{RED93}} or CODEL {{RFC8289}}.

An example of possible signal-to-mitigation action mapping is provided in {{mapping}}.

## Information Model - YANG Module {#infomodel-module}

The "ietf-packet-discard-reporting" module uses the "sx" structure defined in {{!RFC8791}}.

~~~~~~~~~~
<CODE BEGINS>
{::include-fold ./yang/ietf-packet-discard-reporting-sx.yang}
<CODE ENDS>
~~~~~~~~~~

# Data Model   {#datamodel}

This data model implements the information model defined in {{infomodel}} for the interface and device components.  This is classed as a Network Element model as defined by {{?RFC1157}}.

## Structure {#datamodel-structure}

There is a direct mapping between the information model components and their data model implementations, with each component in the hierarchy represented by corresponding YANG containers and leaves.  The following YANG tree diagram shows the complete structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
{::include ./yang/draft-ietf-data-model-tree.txt}
~~~~~~~~~~

## Implementation Requirements {#requirements}

The following requirements apply to the implementation of the data model and are intended to ensure consistent implementation across different vendors and platforms while allowing for platform-specific optimisations where needed.  While the model defines a comprehensive set of counters and statistics, implementations MAY support a subset of the defined features based on device capabilities and operational requirements. However, implementations MUST clearly document which features are supported and how they map to the model.

Requirements 1-10 relate to packets forwarded or discarded by the device, while requirement 11 relates to packets destined for or originating from the device:

1. All instances of Layer 2 frame or Layer 3 packet receipt, transmission, and discards MUST be accounted for.
2. All instances of Layer 2 frame or Layer 3 packet receipt, transmission, and discards SHOULD be attributed to the physical or logical interface of the device where they occur.  Where they cannot be attributed to the interface, they MUST be attributed to the device.
3. An individual frame MUST only be accounted for by either the Layer 2 traffic class or the Layer 2 discard classes within a single direction or context, i.e., ingress or egress or device.  This is to avoid double counting.
4. An individual packet MUST only be accounted for by either the Layer 3 traffic class or the Layer 3 discard classes within a single direction or context, i.e., ingress or egress or device.  This is to avoid double counting.
5. A frame accounted for at Layer 2 SHOULD NOT be accounted for at Layer 3 and vice versa.  An implementation MUST indicate which layers traffic and discards are counted against.  This is to avoid double counting.
6. The aggregate Layer 2 and Layer 3 traffic and discard classes SHOULD account for all underlying frames or packets received, transmitted, and discarded across all other classes.
7. The aggregate Quality of Service (QoS) traffic and no buffer discard classes MUST account for all underlying packets received, transmitted, and discarded across all other classes.
8. In addition to the Layer 2 and Layer 3 aggregate classes, an individual discarded packet MUST only account against a single error, policy, or no-buffer discard subclass.
9. When there are multiple reasons for discarding a packet, the ordering of discard class reporting MUST be defined.
10. If Diffserv {{RFC2475}} is not used, no-buffer discards SHOULD be reported as class0, which represents the default class.
11. Traffic to the device control plane has its own class, however, traffic from the device control plane SHOULD be accounted for in the same way as other egress traffic.

## Usage Examples {#examples}

If all of the requirements are met, a "good" unicast IPv4 packet received would increment:

- interface/ingress/traffic/l3/v4/unicast/packets
- interface/ingress/traffic/l3/v4/unicast/bytes
- interface/ingress/traffic/qos/class_0/packets
- interface/ingress/traffic/qos/class_0/bytes

A received unicast IPv6 packet discarded due to Hop Limit expiry would increment:

- interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/unicast/packets
- interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/unicast/bytes
- interface/ingress/discards/l3/rx/ttl-expired/packets

An IPv4 packet discarded on egress due to no buffers would increment:

- interface/egress/discards/l3/v4/unicast/packets
- interface/egress/discards/l3/v4/unicast/bytes
- interface/egress/discards/no-buffer/class_0/packets
- interface/egress/discards/no-buffer/class_0/bytes

A multicast IPv6 packet dropped due to RPF check failure would increment:

- interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/multicast/packets
- interface/ingress/discards/l3/v6/multicast/bytes
- interface/ingress/discards/policy/l3/rpf/packets

# Security Considerations {#security}

This section discusses security considerations for both the information model and its implementation as a data model.

## Information Model {#security-infomodel}

The information model defined in {{infomodel-module}} specifies a YANG module using {{!RFC8791}} data extensions.  It defines a set of identities, types, and groupings. These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG modules. The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs. As such, there are no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to be considered.

## Data Model {#security-datamodel}

The YANG module specified in {{datamodel-module}} defines a schema for data with data nodes that contain read-only state.  It is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as NETCONF {{?RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{?RFC6242}}. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS {{?RFC8446}}.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{?RFC8341}} provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

The module does not expose any data nodes that are writable, or RPCs. As such, there are no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to be considered.

## Where do packets get dropped? {#wheredropped}

Understanding where packets are discarded in a network device is essential for interpreting discard signals and determining appropriate mitigation actions.  {{ex-drop}} depicts an example of where and why packets may be discarded in a typical single-ASIC, shared-buffered type device. While actual device architectures vary between vendors and platforms, with some using multiple ASICs, distributed forwarding, or different buffering architectures, this example illustrates the common processing stages where packets may be dropped. The logical model for classifying and reporting discards remains consistent regardless of the underlying hardware architecture.

See Appendix C for examples of how these discard signals map to root causes and mitigation actions.

# Example signal-to-mitigation action mapping {#mapping}

The effectiveness of automated mitigation depends on correctly mapping discard signals to root causes and appropriate actions.  {{ex-table}} gives example discard signal-to-mitigation action mappings based on the features described in section 3.

# Implementation Experience {#experience}

This appendix captures practical insights gained from implementing this information model across multiple vendors' platforms, as guidance for future implementers.

1. The number and granularity of discard classes defined in the information model represent a compromise.  It aims to provide sufficient detail to enable appropriate automated actions while avoiding excessive detail, which may hinder quick problem identification.  Additionally, it helps to limit the quantity of data produced per interface, constraining the data volume and device CPU impacts.  While further granularity is possible, the defined schema has generally proven to be sufficient for the task of mitigating unintended packet loss.
2. There are many possible ways to define the discard classification tree.  For example, we could have used a multi-rooted tree, rooted in each protocol.  Instead, we opted to define a tree where protocol discards and causal discard classes are accounted for orthogonally.  This decision reduces the number of combinations of classes and has proven sufficient for determining mitigation actions.
3. NoBuffer discards can be realized differently with different memory architectures. Whether a NoBuffer discard is attributed to ingress or egress can differ accordingly.  For successful auto-mitigation, discards due to egress interface congestion should be reported on egress, while discards due to device-level congestion (e.g. due to exceeding the device forwarding rate) should be reported on ingress.
4. Platforms often account for the number of packets discarded where the TTL has expired (or Hop Limit exceeded), and the device CPU has returned an ICMP Time Exceeded message.  There is typically a policer applied to limit the number of packets sent to the device CPU, however, which implicitly limits the rate of TTL discards that are processed.  One method to account for all packet discards due to TTL expired, even those that are dropped by a policer when being forwarded to the CPU, is to use accounting of all ingress packets received with TTL=1 as a proxy measure.
5. Where no route discards are implemented with a default null route, separate discard accounting is required for any explicit null routes configured, in order to differentiate between interface/ingress/discards/policy/null-route/packets and interface/ingress/discards/errors/no-route/packets.
6. It is useful to account separately for transit packets discarded by ACLs or policers, and packets discarded by ACLs or policers which limit the number of packets to the device control plane.
7. It is not possible to identify a configuration error - e.g., when intended discards are unintended - with device discard metrics alone.  For example, additional context is needed to determine if ACL discards are intended or due to a misconfigured ACL, i.e., with configuration validation before deployment or by detecting a significant change in ACL discards after a configuration change compared to before.
8. Where traffic byte counters need to be 64-bit, packet and discard counters that increase at a lower rate may be encoded in 32-bit.
9. Aggregate counters need to be able to deal with the possibility of discontinuities in the underlying counters.
10. In cases where the reporting device is the source or destination of a tunnel, the ingress protocol for a packet may differ from the egress protocol; if IPv4 is tunnelled over IPv6 for example.  Some implementations may attribute egress discards to the ingress protocol.
11. While the classification tree is seven layers deep, a minimal implementation may only implement the top six layers.
